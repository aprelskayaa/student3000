We live in a 12-story building in the central part of the city. Let me tell you about our apartment.
We live on the second floor, so usually we do not use the elevator. There are four rooms in the apartment – my parents’ room, my little brother’s room, 
the room where I live, and the living room. There are also, of course, a cozy kitchen and a bathroom.

The kitchen is small, but, as I said before, quite cozy. There is a stove, fridge, kettle, microwave, 
table and chairs there. We also have a lot of kitchen utensils such as knives, ladles and so on. There is my mom’s portrait hanging on the wall. The portrait is very good, my father drew it many years ago when they met.

The biggest room in the apartment is the living room. This is where we watch TV in the evening, my little 
brother plays videogames there. My parents’ room is also big, and they have their own TV. If my brother or I, want to watch something they do not watch, they might let us use the living room TV and watch their favorite show in their room. They love police procedurals, I like fantasy series, and my brother likes cartoons. My brother has a small room. There is a big closet full of toys and Lego there. My room is not big either, I have a computer desk. This is where I do my homework.

As for the bathroom, there is not just a toilet and bathtub, there is also a cat litter box there.
We have a cat, her name is Lilly, and she does not have a room, because the whole apartment is her room.

We’ve been living in this apartment since I was little, and I really like it. When I move out someday, 
I hope I will live in an apartment like this one.
Have you ever thought about what your future life is going to be like?
What are you going to do when you finish school? It is never too early or late to start thinking about your future career. Maybe you enjoy some of the subjects at school more than others. 
If you do, this is a good sign, because they will guide you to your future profession.
In today’s world, your future career can be absolutely anything. 
It does not necessarily mean having a boss or working in a company. 
For example, you can become a freelancer. A freelancer is a person who works at home or wherever they want, doing work for their clients. The clients ask a freelancer to do something, and they have to do it until a certain date. As long as the job is getting done, freelancers can choose where and when to work. They can even work at night, or spend a week not working at all, it depends only on them.
Also, there are a lot of jobs that require creativity. For example, you can become a DJ, a musician, or an actor. These professions might require a great deal of training, practice and probably some talent.
Some people become entrepreneurs. They run their own businesses, make jobs and fill the needs of society, although running a business is a lot of responsibility. 
A lot of people depend on an entrepreneur including their employees, partners and clients.
Many people enjoy working in more traditional industries. If you love baking pastry or taking care of animals, you should follow your real passion. It is up to you what occupation to choose.
In conclusion, I would like to say that choosing your future career is not easy but it is surely rewarding to do something you love.
